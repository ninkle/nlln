Have Tensorflow installed  
May possible have to run `pip install QtPy5`  

Once the plot is launched:  
- Zoom option 1: Click and drag a rectangle over the plot to zoom and recompute plot with the input values selected. 
- Zoom option 2: Click the little magnifying glass in the window, then click and drag a rectangle over the plot to zoom without recomputing the plot.  
- Pan: Click the little arrows icon in the window to move around the plot.
